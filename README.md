# rapidEELS

RapidEELS is a Autoencoder-Classifier Framework for denoising low SNR electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectra and classifying their oxidation state.

## About 
This work was done as part of a study using SrFeO3-δ(δrepresents the oxygendeficiency) thin films, as a starting point for rapid identification of real-time EELS data. The films undergo an oxidation state changes from nominally SrFeO3(Fe4+) to SrFeO2.5(Fe3+) as target metrics to benchmark our algorithms.
